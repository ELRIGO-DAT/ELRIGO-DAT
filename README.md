- 👋 Hi, I’m @ELRIGO-DAT
- 👀 I’m interested in coding as I recently took a program with Google that introduced me to SQL and R.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about BI also with Google and Im continuing learning to code in R as it feels better for me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on R coding to learn more and maybe even contibute on a later stage.
- 📫 You can reach me through Github
- 😄 Pronouns: 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Ive never coded before as I was scared that it might be too much for me.
